InfiniteBoost: building infinite ensembles with gradient descent.
[TODO LINK to a paper](TODO link to a paper)

## Description

InfiniteBoost is an approach to building ensembles which combines best sides of random forest and gradient boosting. 

Trees in the ensemble encounter mistakes done by previous trees, but due to modified scheme of encountering contributions
the ensemble converges to the limit, thus avoiding overfitting, just as random forest.

## InfiniteBoost package


(code written in python 2 and some functions in fortran)
